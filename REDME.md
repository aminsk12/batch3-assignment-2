In this blog post, we'll explore how to set up and build a robust E-commerce API using modern web technologies: Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This API will handle operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products and orders, while ensuring data validation and error handling.

Why These Technologies?
Node.js and Express
TypeScript
MongoDB and Mongoose


Project Setup
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB
You can download Node.js and npm from nodejs.org and MongoDB from mongodb.com.

Initial Setup
1. Create Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

bash
Copy code
mkdir express-typescript-mongoose
cd express-typescript-mongoose
2. Initialize npm
Initialize a new npm project by running:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
This creates a package.json file, which will hold the project's metadata and dependencies.

3. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose dotenv
And install the development dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install typescript @types/node @types/express ts-node nodemon --save-dev
4. Set Up TypeScript
Initialize TypeScript configuration:

bash
Copy code
npx tsc --init
Configure the tsconfig.json file to suit your project needs. This file contains compiler options for TypeScript.

5. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project to store environment variables, such as your MongoDB connection string:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
6. Create Directory Structure
Create the necessary directory structure for your project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p src/{controllers,models,routes,utils}
touch src/{index.ts,app.ts}
Development Overview
Setting Up Express Server
Set up the basic Express server in src/app.ts. This file will initialize the Express application and connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

Creating Models
Define the product and order models in src/models using Mongoose. These models will represent the structure of your data and include schemas with validations.

Creating Controllers
Create controllers in src/controllers to handle the business logic for managing products and orders. These controllers will interact with the models and handle the requests and responses.

Creating Routes
Define the routes in src/routes to map endpoints to the corresponding controllers. This is where you will define the API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products and orders.

Integrating Routes into the Application
Integrate the routes into your Express application by importing and using them in src/app.ts.

Running the Application
To start the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start your server and connect to your MongoDB database. Ensure your MongoDB server is running before starting the application.

API Endpoints
Product Management
Create a New Product

Endpoint: /api/products
Method: POST
Retrieve All Products

Endpoint: /api/products
Method: GET
Retrieve a Specific Product by ID

Endpoint: /api/products/:productId
Method: GET
Update Product Information

Endpoint: /api/products/:productId
Method: PUT
Delete a Product

Endpoint: /api/products/:productId
Method: DELETE
Order Management
Create a New Order

Endpoint: /api/orders
Method: POST
Retrieve All Orders

Endpoint: /api/orders
Method: GET
Retrieve Orders by User Email

Endpoint: /api/orders/user/:userEmail
Method: GET
Error Handling
Ensure your API provides meaningful error messages and handles different types of errors gracefully. Use middleware for centralized error handling.

Validation
Use Joi or Zod to validate request data and ensure the integrity of data before it reaches your database. This prevents common issues and makes your API more robust.

Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you have set up a robust E-commerce API using Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This API can be extended further with more features such as user authentication, advanced querying capabilities, and integration with frontend applications.

Happy coding!
